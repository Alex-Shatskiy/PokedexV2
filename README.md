# Pokedex Website
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#Website MVP
I want this website to display every Pokemon, display the stats of each pokemon and show a short list of detials about spesific pokemon. 

Also having a search bar to look for a specific pokemon without having to scroll and search for it manualy.

This project will use the Pokemon API from: [PokiAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

Insperation for this project came from [a dribble photo](https://dribbble.com/shots/6540871-Pokedex-App)
